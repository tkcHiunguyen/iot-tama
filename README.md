# TAMA IOT - Client side (ESP32)

IOT Machine Monitoring System (IMMS) is a system that monitors machine operation by using Hall sensors to collect data on the electricity consumption of each machine at STS. The system also includes ERROR, UNDER MAINTENANCE, and OPERATIONAL buttons to quickly report machine errors, monitor maintenance, and update directly through STS's FAS error reporting system.

The IMMS operates by collecting data from the sensors, storing it, and periodically reporting it to the management web system through hubs.
